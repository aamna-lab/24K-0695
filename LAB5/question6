the first if operator is not true hence we go to the second if operator
but in the second if operator, we have a statement 1!= 2<5
the greater or lesser than sign is taken first since it has the higher precedency compared to not equals to sign.
Now since 2 is less than 5, it will take it as 1!=1, because the condition (2<5) is satisfied
however 1 is equal to 1 , therefore the condition (1!=1) will be false and the else operator for this statement will be run.
which in this case is 30. therefore the output is 30
